                     <p class="p4"> <strong> Snorkeling </strong>
                     <br> 
Puerto Vallarta is a great snorkeling destination. Everyone who visits Puerto Vallarta should try to go snorkeling at least once. You'll be opened up to a whole new world - one of striking beauty and strange and unusual creatures.  You might see a spotted eagle ray flying gently by you, a funny looking needlefish, or even a giant lobster!  In whale season, you can hear the songs of the humpbacks underwater, and often see them jumping off the bow of your boat.  It's truly an amazing sight
<br> <strong>Jungle</strong>
<br> The Western Sierra Madre is covered by thick jungle that grows right to the edge of the Pacific Ocean where most beaches and towns are only accessible by sea. This extraordinary environment provides shelter for not only mammals, reptiles, insects and lesser-known species, but also four hundred bird species of many different sizes and colors and three hundred orchid species. Puerto Vallarta's tropical weather is vital in sustaining the biodiversity, abundant rain and sun sustain a beautiful tropical canopy that covers mountains and feed the different inhabitants of the jungle.</p>

             <p>Puerto Vallarta is filled with a lot of interesting things and offers tourists and newcomers a lot of possibilities to do many things such as fishing, snorkeling, and visiting the jungle. In conclusion, Puerto Vallarta is a great place to visit.</p>
